This is the API that my [portfolio website](https://www.danyo.tech) interfaces with. It is developed with Django and hosted on [Python Anywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/).

_Automated Build and Deployment_
All components are automatically tested with [Github's pipeline](https://github.com/dhong9/danyo/actions). Code coverage results are posted to [CodeCov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/dhong9/danyo).
